Hi there! I am Dmitry, a software engineer from the beautiful [Lindau am Bodensee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindau).
I am currently working at MongoDB, and I am responsible for development of the [MongoDB Ruby Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/)
and [Mongoid ODM](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/).
